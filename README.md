# DevApp_Code
A github repository to demonstrate my coding knowledge. Explore other branches to see more of my work!

My best work:
  - [Titanium](https://github.com/Wharkk/titanium): Production-ready Roblox framework with built-in data architecture, client replication, and monetization systems.
  - [PestLuau](https://github.com/Wharkk/pest-luau): A Luau port of [PestPHP](https://pestphp.com/) by [@nunomaduro](https://github.com/nunomaduro), bringing beautiful test syntax and Test-Driven Development practices to the Roblox ecosystem.

This branch shows a tween configuration I did for a client with clear documentation so he could make new tweens without needing my help.
